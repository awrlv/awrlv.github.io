### 1. How to know if Jekyll is right for you

If you're really into web publishing, you will love Jekyll. If you like front-end design, if you like CSS, if you like designing navigation systems with websites, if you like viewing and working with content in the browser, if you enjoy having control over every aspect of the site, then you will love Jekyll.

If you're technical enough to understand the details of web design and web publishing (especially HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), you will love Jekyll â€” period. Nothing compares to the freedom and flexibility of this static site generator.



### 2. How to know if DITA is right for you

If you're working in a big doc shop, where you have lots of technical writers, and you don't want them focused at all on any aspect of web design, or style sheets, or customization, if you want to have them focus solely on content, on filling up information templates for tasks, concepts, reference material, then DITA might be a good fit.

If you want to plug into an existing platform that will facilitate publishing, and you have a budget and money to spend (like $30k), and you support the idea of information typing and think it's a good approach to doing technical documentation, then DITA will be a good fit for you.
